Proactive API Monitoring & Alerting System
Overview
In today's digital landscape, the availability and reliability of services are paramount. Even a few minutes of downtime can lead to significant financial loss and damage to a company's reputation. This project, the Proactive API Monitoring & Alerting System, is designed to address this challenge head-on.

It provides a robust framework for continuously monitoring the health and uptime of critical API endpoints. System administrators can register their companies and the specific services (endpoints) they need to watch. The system then acts as a relentless watchdog, periodically checking these endpoints and instantly notifying the appropriate personnel the moment an issue is detected. This proactive approach shifts the paradigm from reactive problem-solving to pre-emptive incident management, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

This system is built to be a centralized monitoring hub, perfect for SaaS providers, enterprise applications, or any organization that relies on the consistent availability of its web services.

Core Features
This system is built around a set of powerful and flexible features:

🏢 Dynamic Company & Service Registration:

Easily add, manage, and remove companies within the system.

For each company, register multiple API endpoints (functions) that are critical to its operations. Each endpoint is stored with its unique URL for monitoring.

🔄 Continuous & Automated Monitoring:

A powerful, cron-based scheduling engine automatically "pings" every registered endpoint at configurable intervals.

It doesn't just check for availability; it validates the HTTP response status to ensure the service is functioning correctly (e.g., expecting a 200 OK status).

⚠️ Intelligent & Instant Alerting System:

When an endpoint fails a health check (e.g., returns a 5xx server error, a 4xx client error, or times out), the system immediately logs the incident.

It automatically triggers a notification that is sent to the designated administrators or points of contact for that specific company, ensuring the right people are alerted without delay.

📊 Status Dashboard (Conceptual):

A clean and intuitive user interface provides a high-level overview of the status of all monitored services.

Visually distinguish between services that are UP, DOWN, or experiencing issues, with timestamps for the last check and failure.

How It Works
The logical flow of the system is straightforward yet effective:

Configuration: An administrator registers a new company and adds the specific API endpoints (URLs) that require monitoring. Contact information for alerts is also associated with the company.

Scheduling: A background scheduler (e.g., a cron job) adds the monitoring tasks to a queue. Each task is scheduled to run at a regular, pre-defined interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).

Execution & Validation: When a task runs, the monitoring engine sends an HTTP request to the target endpoint. It then inspects the response, primarily checking the HTTP status code to determine if it was successful.

State Management: The system records the outcome of the check. If a service that was previously "up" fails, its status is changed to "down".

Alerting: If a status change indicates a failure, the alerting module is triggered. It fetches the contact details for the affected company and dispatches an alert (e.g., via email, SMS, etc.) with details about the failed endpoint.
