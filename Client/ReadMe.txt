Proactive API Monitoring & Alerting System - Frontend
This repository contains the frontend for the Proactive API Monitoring System. It is a modern, responsive, and fast web application built with React and Next.js 15.

This frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the monitoring system. All data fetching is handled server-side (SSR) for optimal performance and SEO. It communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls to manage companies, endpoints, and display status information.
