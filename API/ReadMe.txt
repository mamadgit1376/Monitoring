Of course. Here are complete README.md files for both your backend and frontend projects, tailored to the technologies you've used.

🚀 Backend README: ASP.NET Core API
This file should be named README.md and placed in the root of your ASP.NET Core project folder.

Proactive API Monitoring & Alerting System - Backend
This repository contains the backend service for the Proactive API Monitoring System. It is a powerful and scalable RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core 9 and Entity Framework Core 9, backed by a Microsoft SQL Server database.

This backend is the engine of the entire system, responsible for all core logic, including data persistence, scheduling monitoring tasks, and dispatching alerts.

Technology Stack
Framework: ASP.NET Core 9 Web API

Database: Microsoft SQL Server

ORM: Entity Framework Core 9

Architecture: RESTful API

Core Features
Secure RESTful API: Provides a full suite of secure endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting companies, monitoring endpoints, and viewing status history.

Database Management: Leverages EF Core 9 for robust data modeling and automated database schema management through code-first migrations.

Monitoring & Alerting Engine: Contains the core business logic for periodically pinging registered endpoints, validating their responses, and triggering alerts upon failure.

Scalable & Performant: Built on the high-performance Kestrel web server and the asynchronous processing capabilities of ASP.NET Core to handle numerous concurrent monitoring tasks efficiently.

API Endpoints
The API provides standard RESTful endpoints for managing resources. Here are some examples:

POST /api/companies - Register a new company.

GET /api/companies/{id} - Get details for a specific company.

POST /api/monitors - Add a new API endpoint to monitor for a company.

GET /api/monitors/status - Get the current status of all monitored endpoints.

DELETE /api/monitors/{id} - Stop monitoring a specific endpoint.

Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get the backend running locally.

Prerequisites
.NET 9 SDK

Microsoft SQL Server (Express, Developer, or other editions)

Configuration
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-backend-repo.git
cd your-backend-repo
Configure Database Connection:

Open the appsettings.json file.

Update the DefaultConnection string to point to your local or remote SQL Server instance.

JSON

"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server_name;Database=ApiMonitoringDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
Apply EF Core Migrations:

Run the following commands in your terminal from the project's root directory to create the database and apply the schema.

Bash

dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet ef database update
Run the Application:

Bash

dotnet run
The API will now be running on the configured port (e.g., https://localhost:7001).

❗ Disclaimer: Portfolio Version
Please be aware that this repository represents a portfolio-level demonstration of the project.

It is intended to showcase the core architectural concepts and my skills in building a robust backend with ASP.NET Core. The production-grade version of this project is significantly more advanced and includes features like multi-tenancy, OAuth 2.0 security, integration with message queues for alerting (like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus), and advanced analytics logging.
