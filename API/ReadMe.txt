Of course. Here are complete README.md files for both your backend and frontend projects, tailored to the technologies you've used.

🚀 Backend README: ASP.NET Core API
This file should be named README.md and placed in the root of your ASP.NET Core project folder.

Proactive API Monitoring & Alerting System - Backend
This repository contains the backend service for the Proactive API Monitoring System. It is a powerful and scalable RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core 9 and Entity Framework Core 9, backed by a Microsoft SQL Server database.

This backend is the engine of the entire system, responsible for all core logic, including data persistence, scheduling monitoring tasks, and dispatching alerts.

Technology Stack
Framework: ASP.NET Core 9 Web API

Database: Microsoft SQL Server

ORM: Entity Framework Core 9

Architecture: RESTful API

Core Features
Secure RESTful API: Provides a full suite of secure endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting companies, monitoring endpoints, and viewing status history.

Database Management: Leverages EF Core 9 for robust data modeling and automated database schema management through code-first migrations.

Monitoring & Alerting Engine: Contains the core business logic for periodically pinging registered endpoints, validating their responses, and triggering alerts upon failure.

Scalable & Performant: Built on the high-performance Kestrel web server and the asynchronous processing capabilities of ASP.NET Core to handle numerous concurrent monitoring tasks efficiently.
